# Outpost API Contract Tests

This directory contains contract tests for the Outpost API. The tests use a Speakeasy-generated TypeScript SDK to validate the API implementation against the OpenAPI specification.

## Overview

The primary goal of these tests is to ensure that the Outpost API implementation strictly adheres to its OpenAPI contract. This is achieved indirectly by using a TypeScript SDK that is generated directly from the OpenAPI specification (`../apis/openapi.yaml`).

The workflow is as follows:

1.  The OpenAPI specification serves as the single source of truth.
2.  The Speakeasy CLI generates a TypeScript SDK based on this specification.
3.  The test suite is written against the generated SDK.

Because the SDK's models and methods are a direct representation of the OpenAPI spec, any deviation in the API's behavior (such as incorrect response payloads or status codes) will cause the SDK's built-in validation to fail, thus failing the tests.

## Quick Start

The recommended way to run the tests is using the provided script, which ensures the API is healthy before executing the test suite.

```bash
# 1. Ensure all prerequisites are met (see below)

# 2. Generate and build the TypeScript SDK
./scripts/regenerate-sdk.sh

# 3. Install test suite dependencies
npm install

# 4. Ensure an Outpost instance is running and accessible

# 5. Run the test script
./scripts/run-tests.sh
```

## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, ensure you have the following:

1.  **Node.js**: Version 18.0.0 or higher.
2.  **Go**: Required if you plan to run an Outpost instance locally.
3.  **Speakeasy CLI**: Required for regenerating the SDK.
4.  **Running Outpost Instance**: The tests require a running Outpost API server, either locally or on a remote server.
5.  **Environment File**: A `.env` file must be created and configured for the test suite.

## Setting Up an Outpost Instance

These tests must be run against a live Outpost server. You can either run one locally or target a remote instance.

### Option 1: Running a Local Instance

**1. Configure the Outpost Environment:**

From the root of the repository, copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Ensure the `API_KEY` variable is set in this file. This is the key your local Outpost instance will use.

**2. Start the Outpost Server:**

In a dedicated terminal, run the following command from the repository root:

```bash
go run cmd/outpost/main.go
```

The server should now be running and accessible at `http://localhost:3333`.

### Option 2: Targeting a Remote Instance

If you are running tests against a remote Outpost server, you must configure the `API_BASE_URL` in the test suite's `.env` file to point to your server's address.

## Test Suite Configuration

The test suite requires its own `.env` file, located within this directory (`spec-sdk-tests`).

**1. Create the `.env` file:**

Start by copying the example file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**2. Configure Environment Variables:**

The following variables are **mandatory** and must be set in your `.env` file:

- `API_KEY`: The API key for authenticating with the Outpost API. **This key must match the API key configured on the target Outpost instance.**
- `TEST_TOPICS`: A comma-separated list of topics that already exist on your Outpost instance (e.g., `user.created,user.updated`). The tests will fail if these topics do not exist.

Optional variables:

- `API_BASE_URL`: The base URL of the Outpost API (default: `http://localhost:3333/api/v1`). **Set this if you are targeting a remote instance.**
- `TENANT_ID`: The tenant ID to use for the tests (default: `default`).
- `DEBUG_API_REQUESTS`: Set to `true` to enable detailed request logging (default: `false`).

## SDK Regeneration

If you make changes to the OpenAPI specification (`../apis/openapi.yaml`), you must regenerate the TypeScript SDK to ensure the tests are validating against the latest contract.

The `regenerate-sdk.sh` script handles this process automatically:

```bash
./scripts/regenerate-sdk.sh
```

This script will:

1.  Navigate to the SDK directory (`/sdks/outpost-typescript`).
2.  Run `speakeasy run` to regenerate the SDK files.
3.  Run `npm run build` to compile the new SDK code.

After regenerating, you may need to update the tests if there are breaking changes in the spec.

## NPM Scripts

The following scripts are available to run, lint, and format the tests:

| Script                    | Description                                                    |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm test`                | Runs the full validation test suite.                           |
| `npm run test:validation` | Runs the mocha test suite directly.                            |
| `npm run test:watch`      | Runs tests in watch mode, re-running on file changes.          |
| `npm run test:coverage`   | Generates a test coverage report.                              |
| `npm run lint:spec`       | Lints the OpenAPI specification file (`../apis/openapi.yaml`). |
| `npm run validate:spec`   | Validates the syntax of the OpenAPI specification.             |
| `npm run format`          | Formats all TypeScript files using Prettier.                   |
| `npm run format:check`    | Checks for formatting issues without modifying files.          |
| `npm run type-check`      | Runs TypeScript type-checking without compiling.               |

## Test Structure

The tests are organized by resource type within the `tests/` directory.

```
tests/
├── destinations/
│   ├── gcp-pubsub.test.ts    # GCP Pub/Sub destination tests
│   └── ...                   # Other destination types
└── utils/
    └── sdk-client.ts         # SDK client wrapper
```

## Writing Tests

When adding new tests, please adhere to the following guidelines:

1.  **Use the SDK Client**: Import and use the shared SDK client from `utils/sdk-client.ts`.
2.  **Cover All Scenarios**: Test both happy paths and error conditions.
3.  **Validate Responses**: Ensure response structures conform to the OpenAPI specification. The SDK performs automatic validation, but explicit assertions are encouraged.
4.  **Be Thorough**: Test all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for each resource.
