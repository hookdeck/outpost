## Code Review

When reviewing pull requests:

### Formatting
- Wrap all review feedback in a `<details>` section with a summary to keep comment threads easy to follow
- Avoid using `#1`, `#2`, etc. for numbering as `#N` refers to issues/PRs in GitHub. Use `1.`, `a)`, or bullet points instead

### Content
Provide feedback on:
- Code quality and best practices
- Potential bugs or issues
- Performance considerations
- Security concerns
- Test coverage

Be constructive and helpful in your feedback.
