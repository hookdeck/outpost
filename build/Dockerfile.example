# We do NOT recommend using this Dockerfile in production. Instead, use the official
# hookdeck/outpost image from Docker Hub:
#   docker pull hookdeck/outpost:latest
#
# The official image is optimized, regularly updated, and fully supported.

# This example is provided for educational purposes and as a starting point for
