title: Destinations
---

Outpost supports multiple event destination types. Each tenant can have multiple destinations, up to a maximum set by the `MAX_DESTINATIONS_PER_TENANT` environment variable (defaulting to `20`).

> We recommend setting the `MAX_DESTINATIONS_PER_TENANT` value as low as is appropriate for your use case to prevent abuse and performance degradation. Updating the value to a lower value later will not delete existing destinations.

## Supported Destinations

| Destination | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [Webhook](/docs/destinations/webhook) | Send events via HTTP POST to a URL |
| [Hookdeck](/docs/destinations/hookdeck) | Route events through Hookdeck Event Gateway |
| [AWS Kinesis](/docs/destinations/aws-kinesis) | Stream events to Amazon Kinesis |
| [AWS SQS](/docs/destinations/aws-sqs) | Send events to an Amazon SQS queue |
| [AWS S3](/docs/destinations/aws-s3) | Store events in an Amazon S3 bucket |
| [Azure Service Bus](/docs/destinations/azure-service-bus) | Send events to Azure Service Bus |
| [GCP Pub/Sub](/docs/destinations/gcp-pubsub) | Publish events to Google Cloud Pub/Sub |
| [RabbitMQ](/docs/destinations/rabbitmq) | Send events to a RabbitMQ exchange |

See the [roadmap](/docs/references/roadmap) for planned destination types. To be eligible as a destination type, it must be asynchronous in nature and not run any business logic.

## Creating a Destination

Destinations can be registered through the tenant portal or via the API. Each destination type has its own configuration and credentials. Refer to the [Create Destination API](/docs/api/destinations#create-destination) for the required `config` and `credentials` fields for each destination type.

```sh
curl --location 'https://<OUTPOST_API_URL>/api/v1/tenants/<TENANT_ID>/destinations' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>' \
--data '{
  "type": "<TYPE>",
  "topics": ["<TOPIC>"],
  "config": { ... },
  "credentials": { ... }
}'
```

## Destination Filtering

Destinations can be configured with filters to selectively receive only events matching specific criteria. This allows tenants to create fine-grained routing rules based on event properties.

See the [Filters](/docs/features/filter) documentation for the complete filter syntax and examples.

## Getting Destination Types & Schemas

When using the API, you may want to build your own UI to capture user input on the destination configuration. Since each destination requires a specific configuration, the `GET /destination-types` endpoint provides a JSON schema for standardized input fields for each destination type.

For example, for the `webhook` type:

```json
{
  "type": "webhook",
  "label": "Webhook",
  "description": "Send events via an HTTP POST request to a URL",
  "icon": "<svg />",
  "instructions": "Some *markdown*",
  "remote_setup_url": null,
  "config_fields": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "label": "URL",
      "description": "The URL to send the event to",
      "pattern": "/((([A-Za-z]{3,9}:(?://)?)(?:[-;:&=+$,w]+@)?[A-Za-z0-9.-]+(:[0-9]+)?|(?:www.|[-;:&=+$,w]+@)[A-Za-z0-9.-]+)((?:/[+~%/.w-_]*)???(?:[-+=&;%@.w_]*)#?(?:[w]*))?)/",
      "required": true
    }
  ],
  "credential_fields": []
}
```

### `config_fields` `Field[]`

Config fields are non-secret values that can be stored and displayed to the user in plain text.

### `credential_fields` `Field[]`

Credential fields are secret values that will be AES encrypted and obfuscated to the user. Some credentials may not be obfuscated; the destination type dictates the obfuscation logic.

### `instructions` `string`

Some destinations will require instructions to configure. For instance, with Pub/Sub, the user will need to create a service account and grant some permissions to that service account. The value is a markdown string to be rendered with any markdown rendering library. Images will be hosted through the GitHub repository.

### `remote_setup_url`

Some destinations may have OAuth flow or other managed setup flow that can be triggered with a link. If a `remote_setup_url` is set, then the user should be prompted to follow the link to configure the destination.

See the [building your own UI guide](/docs/guides/building-your-own-ui) for recommended UI patterns and wireframes for implementation in your own app.

## Customizing Destination Type Definitions & Instructions

The destination type definitions (label, description, icon, etc) and instructions can be customized by setting the `DESTINATIONS_METADATA_PATH` environment variable to a path on disk containing the destination type definitions and instructions. Outpost will load both the default destination type definitions and any custom destination type definitions and merge them.

The metadata path is a directory containing a `providers` directory with a subdirectory for each destination type. Each destination type directory contains a `metadata.json` file and an `instructions.md` file. You can find the default destination type definitions and instructions in the [outpost-providers](https://github.com/hookdeck/outpost/tree/main/internal/destregistry/providers) folder.
