title: "Publish from GCP Pub/Sub"
---

This guide provides information on using GCP Pub/Sub to publish events to Outpost.

## Message Structure

GCP Pub/Sub messages should have the same payload structure as the [Publish API endpoint](/docs/references/api#publish).

```json
{
  "tenant_id": "<TENANT_ID>",
  "destination_id": "<DESTINATION_ID>", // Optional. Provide a way of routing events to a specific destination
  "topic": "topic.name", // Topic defined in TOPICS environment variable
  "eligible_for_retry": true | false, // Should event delivery be retried. Default is true.
  "metadata": Payload, // can by any JSON payload,
  "data": Payload // can by any JSON payload
}
```

## GCP Pub/Sub Setup

[Create a topic](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/create-topic) and [create a pull subscription](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/create-subscription) within GCP Pub/Sub.

Once you have these in place, you can configure Outpost to subscribe to receive events and then publish them to subscribed Outpost Destinations.

## Configuration

Provide Outpost with credentials, topic, and subscription for your GCP Pub/Sub instance used for publishing events.

### Environment Variables

```
PUBLISH_GCP_PUBSUB_PROJECT=""
PUBLISH_GCP_PUBSUB_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS=""
PUBLISH_GCP_PUBSUB_TOPIC=""
PUBLISH_GCP_PUBSUB_SUBSCRIPTION=""
```

#### Example

```
PUBLISH_GCP_PUBSUB_PROJECT="my-gcp-project"
PUBLISH_GCP_PUBSUB_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS="single_line_json_string"
PUBLISH_GCP_PUBSUB_TOPIC="outpost-publish"
PUBLISH_GCP_PUBSUB_SUBSCRIPTION="outpost-publish-sub"
```

### YAML

```yaml
publishmq:
  gcp_pubsub:
    project: <GCP_PROJECT>
    service_account_credentials: <GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS>
    topic: <GCP_PUBSUB_TOPIC>
    subscription: <GCP_PUBSUB_SUBSCRIPTION>
```

#### Example

```yaml
publishmq:
  gcp_pubsub:
    project: "GCP_PUBSUB_PROJECT" # GCP project ID
    service_account_credentials: "GCP_PUBSUB_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS" # Contents of service account credentials JSON file
    topic: "outpost-publish" # Pub/Sub to read for published events
    subscription: "outpost-publish-sub" # Pub/Sub subscription for published events
