## Outpost Distribution

Outpost is distributed as a binary and as a Docker image.

The binaries are available via [GitHub releases](https://github.com/hookdeck/outpost/releases).

The Docker image can be found on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/hookdeck/outpost/tags).

The Outpost repository provides an [example helm chart](https://github.com/hookdeck/outpost/tree/main/examples/kubernetes) for deployment via Kubernetes.

## Outpost Services

The `outpost` executable has three entry points:

- `delivery`
- `api`
- `log`

Services are and other configuration are set via a YAML file. See the [example Outpost configuration file](https://github.com/hookdeck/outpost/tree/main/.outpost.yaml.example).

You can omit the `service` entry point to start all 3 services within the same process. However, this is not recommended.

## Service Resource Allocation

Since each service has different usage and performance profile, it's recommended that each service be operated and scaled independently.

Once we have completed [initial benchmarking](https://github.com/hookdeck/outpost/issues/207), we'll provide guidance on resource allocation based on expected usage and load.

## Dependencies

Outpost requires the following dependencies:

- Redis
- PostgreSQL
- A log queue such as RabbitMQ or AWS SQS
- A delivery queue such as RabbitMQ or AWS SQS
- Optionally, a publish queue such as RabbitMQ or AWS SQS

Each of these will need to be provisioned and allocated sufficient resources based on expected usage and load.
