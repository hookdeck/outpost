title: "Publish from RabbitMQ"
---

This guide provides information on using RabbitMQ to publish events to Outpost.

## Message Structure

RabbitMQ messages should have the same payload structure as the [Publish API endpoint](/docs/references/api#publish).

```json
{
  "tenant_id": "<TENANT_ID>",
  "destination_id": "<DESTINATION_ID>", // Optional. Provide a way of routing events to a specific destination
  "topic": "topic.name", // Topic defined in TOPICS environment variable
  "eligible_for_retry": true | false, // Should event delivery be retried. Default is true.
  "metadata": Payload, // can by any JSON payload,
  "data": Payload // can by any JSON payload
}
```

## Configuration

Provide Outpost with connection and routing information for your RabbitMQ instance used for publishing events.
