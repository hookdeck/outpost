title: Delivery & Retries
---

Outpost keeps track of each event, its status, and the delivery attempts. Outpost operates on an at-least-once delivery guarantee, meaning messages may be re-delivered. While this should be rare, consumers can use the unique Event ID to deduplicate messages.

## Automatic Retries

By default, Outpost will automatically retry events if the destination is unavailable, has incorrect configuration, or if the destination returns a non-2xx HTTP response code. Automatic retries are enabled by default, and the retry strategy can be configured using the environment variables `MAX_RETRY_LIMIT` and `RETRY_INTERVAL_SECONDS`.

The retry interval uses an exponential backoff algorithm with a base of `2`.

## Manual Retries

Manual retries can be triggered for any given event via the [Event API](/docs/api/events#retry-event-delivery) or user portal.

## Disabled destinations

If the destination for an event is disabled—through the API, user portal, or automatically because a [failure threshold](/docs/features/alerts) has been reached—the event will be discarded and cannot be retried.
