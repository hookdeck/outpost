title: "Outpost Quickstart: Docker with RabbitMQ or AWS SQS via LocalStack"
---

Local Docker setup for Outpost using Docker Compose. This setup includes:

- Outpost services (API, delivery, and log processors). See the [architecture](/docs/concepts#architecture) for more details.
- Redis as KV & entity storage
- PostgreSQL as log storage
- RabbitMQ or AWS SQS via LocalStack for message queuing

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

## Setup

1. Clone the Outpost repo:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/hookdeck/outpost.git
   ```

2. Navigate to `outpost/examples/docker-compose/`:

   ```sh
   cd outpost/examples/docker-compose/
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file from the top-level example file:

```sh
cp ../../.env.example .env
```

4. Update the `API_KEY` value within the new `.env` file.

5. There are two options to run Outpost locally for this quickstart. Choose one of the following:

   1. With RabbitMQ:

   ```sh
   docker-compose -f compose.yml -f compose-rabbitmq.yml up
   ```

   2. With SQS via LocalStack:

   ```sh
   docker-compose -f compose.yml -f compose-awssqs.yml up
   ```

## Verify Installation

1. Check the services are running:

   ```sh
   curl localhost:3333/api/v1/healthz
   ```

   Wait until you get a `OK%` response.

2. Create a tenant with the following command, replacing `<TENANT_ID>` with a unique identifier such as "your_org_name", and the `<API_KEY>` with the value you set in your `.env`:

   ```sh
   curl --location --request PUT 'localhost:3333/api/v1/<TENANT_ID>' \
   --header 'Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>'
   ```

3. Run a local server exposed via a localtunnel or use a hosted service such as the [Hookdeck Console](https://console.hookdeck.com?ref=github-outpost) to capture webhook events.

4. Create a webhook destination where events will be delivered to with the following command. Again, replace `<TENANT_ID>` and `<API_KEY>`. Also, replace `<URL>` with the webhook destinations URL:

   ```sh
   curl --location 'localhost:3333/api/v1/<TENANT_ID>/destinations' \
   --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
   --header 'Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>' \
   --data '{
       "type": "webhook",
       "topics": ["*"],
       "config": {
           "url": "<URL>"
       }
   }'
   ```

5. Publish an event, remembering to replace `<API_KEY>` and `<TENANT_ID>`:

   ```sh
   curl --location 'localhost:3333/api/v1/publish' \
   --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
   --header 'Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>' \
   --data '{
       "tenant_id": "<TENANT_ID>",
       "topic": "user.created",
       "eligible_for_retry": true,
       "metadata": {
           "meta": "data"
       },
       "data": {
           "user_id": "userid"
       }
   }'
   ```

6. Check the logs on your server or your webhook capture tool for the delivered event.
