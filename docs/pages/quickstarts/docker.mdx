title: "Outpost Quickstart: Docker with RabbitMQ or AWS SQS via LocalStack"
---

Local Docker setup for Outpost using Docker Compose. This setup includes:

- Outpost services (API, delivery, and log processors). See the [architecture](/docs/concepts#architecture) for more details.
- Redis as KV & entity storage
- PostgreSQL as log storage
- RabbitMQ or AWS SQS via LocalStack for message queuing

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

## Setup

1. Clone the Outpost repo:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/hookdeck/outpost.git
   ```

2. Navigate to `outpost/examples/docker-compose/`:

   ```sh
   cd outpost/examples/docker-compose/
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file from the top-level example file:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Update the `$API_KEY` value within the new `.env` file.

5. There are two options to run Outpost locally for this quickstart. Choose one of the following:

   1. With RabbitMQ:

   ```sh
   docker-compose -f compose.yml -f compose-rabbitmq.yml -f compose-postgres.yml up
   ```

   2. With SQS via LocalStack:

   ```sh
   docker-compose -f compose.yml -f compose-awssqs.yml -f compose-postgres.yml up
   ```

## Verify Installation

1. Check the services are running:

   ```sh
   curl localhost:3333/api/v1/healthz
   ```

   Wait until you get a `OK%` response.

2. Create a tenant with the following command, replacing `$TENANT_ID` with a unique identifier such as "your_org_name", and the `$API_KEY` with the value you set in your `.env`:

   :::tip

   You can use shell variables to store the tenant ID and API key for easier use in the following commands:

   ```sh
   TENANT_ID=your_org_name
   API_KEY=your_api_key
   URL=your_webhook_url
   ```

   :::

   ```sh
   curl --location --request PUT "localhost:3333/api/v1/$TENANT_ID" \
   --header "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY"
   ```

3. Run a local server exposed via a localtunnel or use a hosted service such as the [Hookdeck Console](https://console.hookdeck.com?ref=github-outpost) to capture webhook events.

4. Create a webhook destination where events will be delivered to with the following command. Again, replace `$TENANT_ID` and `$API_KEY`. Also, replace `$URL` with the webhook destinations URL:

   ```sh
   curl --location "localhost:3333/api/v1/$TENANT_ID/destinations" \
   --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
   --header "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
   --data '{
       "type": "webhook",
       "topics": ["*"],
       "config": {
           "url": "'"$URL"'"
        }
    }'
   ```

5. Publish an event, remembering to replace `$API_KEY` and `$TENANT_ID`:

   ```sh
   curl --location "localhost:3333/api/v1/publish" \
   --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
   --header "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
   --data '{
       "tenant_id": "'"$TENANT_ID"'",
       "topic": "user.created",
       "eligible_for_retry": true,
       "metadata": {
           "meta": "data"
       },
       "data": {
           "user_id": "userid"
       }
   }'
   ```

6. Check the logs on your server or your webhook capture tool for the delivered event.

7. Get an Outpost portal link for the tenant:

   ```sh
   curl "localhost:3333/api/v1/$TENANT_ID/portal" \
   --header "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY"
   ```

   The response will look something like the following:

   ```json
   { "redirect_url": "http://localhost:3333?token=$TOKEN" }
   ```

   The `token` value is an API-generated JWT.

   Open the `redirect_url` link to view the Outpost portal.

Continue to use the [Outpost API](https://outpost.hookdeck.com/docs/references/api) or the Outpost portal to add and test more destinations.
