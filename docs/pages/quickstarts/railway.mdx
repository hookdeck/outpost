title: "Outpost Quickstart: Railway"
---

Deploy Outpost to Railway with a one-click deployment. Railway provides a hosted cloud platform that automatically handles infrastructure provisioning and scaling.

## Prerequisites

- [Railway account](https://railway.com)

## Setup

1. Deploy Outpost to Railway using the one-click deployment button:

   [![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/deploy/outpost-starter?referralCode=NRulS_)

2. Once the deployment is complete, configure your `TOPICS` environment variable to the topics supported for destination subscriptions, publishing, and routing of events. For example:

   ```
   TOPICS=user.created,user.updated,user.deleted
   ```

3. Note the generated `API_KEY` environment variable value and the public Railway URL of your Outpost instance for authentication and API requests.

## Verify Installation

:::tip

You can use shell variables to store the tenant ID and API key for easier use in the following commands:

```sh
# Replace with your actual Railway app public URL, found in the Railway dashboard under "Domains"
OUTPOST_URL=https://your-railway-app.railway.app
TENANT_ID=your_org_name
API_KEY=your_api_key
URL=your_webhook_url
```

:::

1. Check that the services are running by replacing `$OUTPOST_URL` with your Railway public URL:

   ```sh
   curl $OUTPOST_URL/api/v1/healthz
   ```

   Wait until you get an `OK` response.

2. Create a tenant with the following command, replacing `$TENANT_ID` with a unique identifier such as "your_org_name", and the `$API_KEY` with the value from your Railway environment variables:

   ```sh
   curl --location --request PUT "$OUTPOST_URL/api/v1/$TENANT_ID" \
   --header "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY"
   ```

3. Run a local server exposed via a localtunnel or use a hosted service such as the [Hookdeck Console](https://console.hookdeck.com?ref=github-outpost) to capture webhook events.

4. Create a webhook destination where events will be delivered to using the following command. Again, replace `$TENANT_ID` and `$API_KEY`. Also, replace `$URL` with the webhook destination's URL:

   ```sh
   curl --location "$OUTPOST_URL/api/v1/$TENANT_ID/destinations" \
   --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
   --header "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
   --data '{
       "type": "webhook",
       "topics": ["*"],
       "config": {
           "url": "'"$URL"'"
        }
    }'
   ```

5. Publish an event, remembering to replace `$API_KEY` and `$TENANT_ID`:

   ```sh
   curl --location "$OUTPOST_URL/api/v1/publish" \
   --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
   --header "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
   --data '{
       "tenant_id": "'"$TENANT_ID"'",
       "topic": "user.created",
       "eligible_for_retry": true,
       "metadata": {
           "meta": "data"
       },
       "data": {
           "user_id": "userid"
       }
   }'
   ```

6. Check the logs on your server or your webhook capture tool for the delivered event.

7. Get an Outpost portal link for the tenant:

   ```sh
   curl "$OUTPOST_URL/api/v1/$TENANT_ID/portal" \
   --header "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY"
   ```

   The response will look something like the following:

   ```json
   { "redirect_url": "https://$OUTPOST_URL?token=$TOKEN" }
   ```

   The `token` value is an API-generated JWT.

   Open the `redirect_url` link to view the Outpost portal.

Continue to use the [Outpost API](https://outpost.hookdeck.com/docs/references/api) or the Outpost portal to add and test more destinations.
