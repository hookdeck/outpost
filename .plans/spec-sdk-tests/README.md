# OpenAPI Validation Test Suite - Implementation Plans

This directory contains detailed planning documents for the next phases of the OpenAPI validation test suite project.

## Current State (Completed)

- ✅ **Test Suite**: 147 comprehensive tests across 8 destination types
- ✅ **Test Results**: 129 passing tests (87.8% pass rate)
- ✅ **Coverage**: All destination types tested (Webhook, AWS SQS, RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus, AWS S3, Hookdeck, AWS Kinesis, GCP Pub/Sub)
- ✅ **Documentation**: `TEST_STATUS.md` with detailed results and analysis
- ✅ **Issue Tracking**: 3 GitHub issues created for backend improvements
- ✅ **Test Infrastructure**: Factory pattern, SDK client utilities, comprehensive test suite

## Next Phases

This plan directory outlines the roadmap for enhancing the test suite with production-ready features:

### 1. [CI/CD Integration](./01-ci-cd-integration.md)
Automate test execution in GitHub Actions to ensure continuous validation of API endpoints against the OpenAPI specification.

**Key Outcomes:**
- Automated test runs on PRs and commits
- Docker-based test environment
- Test status badges
- Failure notifications

### 2. [Coverage Reporting](./02-coverage-reporting.md)
Track and visualize which OpenAPI endpoints are tested, identify gaps, and enforce coverage thresholds.

**Key Outcomes:**
- Automated coverage reports
- Visual coverage dashboards
- Coverage trend tracking
- Minimum coverage enforcement

### 3. [Contributing Documentation](./03-contributing-docs.md)
Provide clear guidelines for developers to add new tests and understand the testing architecture.

**Key Outcomes:**
- Updated CONTRIBUTING.md
- Test development guide
- Factory pattern documentation
- Development workflow examples

### 4. [Implementation Order](./04-implementation-order.md)
Recommended sequence for implementing the above phases with effort estimates and success criteria.

**Key Outcomes:**
- Prioritized roadmap
- Dependency mapping
- Effort estimates
- Success metrics

## Plan Structure

Each planning document follows this structure:

1. **Overview** - Purpose and goals
2. **Requirements** - Specific needs and constraints
3. **Technical Approach** - Implementation details
4. **Examples** - Code snippets and configurations
5. **Acceptance Criteria** - Definition of done
6. **Dependencies** - Related systems and prerequisites
7. **Risks & Considerations** - Potential challenges

## How to Use These Plans

1. **Review** - Read through each plan to understand the scope
2. **Prioritize** - Use `04-implementation-order.md` to sequence work
3. **Implement** - Follow the technical approaches and examples
4. **Validate** - Check against acceptance criteria
5. **Iterate** - Update plans based on learnings
