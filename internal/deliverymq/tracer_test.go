TODO: Add tests for event tracer and metrics collection

Below are suggested scenarios and approaches that could be used to test the tracing
and metrics functionality. These are recommendations and can be adapted based on specific needs:

Potential Test Scenarios:
1. Successful Delivery
   - Verify eventTracer.Deliver() is called with correct DeliveryEvent
   - Verify span is created and ended properly
   - Verify metrics are recorded:
     * Delivery latency
     * Event delivered counter with status="ok"

2. Failed Delivery
   - Verify eventTracer.Deliver() is called
   - Verify span records error
   - Verify metrics are recorded:
     * Delivery latency
     * Event delivered counter with status="failed"

3. System Errors (Pre/Post Delivery)
   - Verify span records appropriate error type
   - Verify metrics reflect system errors vs delivery errors

4. Retry Scenarios
   - Verify spans are properly linked across retry attempts
   - Verify metrics include attempt count

Implementation Suggestions:
- Create a mock event tracer that can:
  * Record span creation/end calls
  * Capture recorded errors
  * Verify metric recording calls
- Consider assertions for:
  * Correct span context propagation
  * Error recording
  * Metric label accuracy
  * Timing of span operations
- Consider separating metric verification into its own test suite

These tests will help ensure the observability pipeline works correctly,
but the actual implementation may vary based on specific requirements and constraints.
